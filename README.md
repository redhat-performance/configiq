# ConfigIQ

LLM inference sizing, GPU comparison, and cost modeling for engineers and infrastructure teams.

## Live

- [configiq.xyz](https://configiq.xyz) (latest release)
- [configiq.dev](https://configiq.dev) (latest commit)

Built with Next.js + PatternFly, powered by our [AISimulators](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/aisimulate) [REST API](https://aisimulators.dev/docs).

## What it does

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Performance** | Fast GPU memory and cost estimate from model + load profile |
| **Recommend Sizing** | Detailed sizing with batching, quantization, and cost modeling |
| **KV Cache Calculator** | Memory breakdown and KV cache capacity analysis |
| **GPU Explorer** | Compare GPUs across memory, throughput, cost, and availability |
| **Hybrid Savings** | Model cost savings across cloud, on-premise, and hybrid strategies |
| **Routing Economics** | Analyze request routing between model tiers |
| **Cluster cost** | Estimate costs for multi-node GPU clusters |

## Tested-model validation

ConfigIQ maintains empirically trained performance-envelope classifiers for
supported model and hardware pairs. The classifiers are built from sanitized,
pinned ground-truth data and served by Triton FIL; the webapp consumes their
registry and dashboard payloads through `/api/tested-models`.

The complete pipeline, data boundary, artifact schema, and deployment procedure
are documented in [docs/tested-models.md](docs/tested-models.md). Source scripts
and regression tests are under [scripts/tested_models](scripts/tested_models).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.19.0
- npm >= 10

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redhat-performance/configiq.git
cd configiq
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

App runs at **http://localhost:3000**.

### Available commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run type-check   # TypeScript check without building
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm test             # Vitest test suite
```

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Next.js 16 App Router + TypeScript |
| UI | PatternFly v6 |
| Backend APIs | [AISimulators](https://aisimulators.dev/docs) for GPU sizing and estimation; aicostings for pricing |

## Contributing

### Before opening a PR

Run these checks before opening a PR:

```bash
npm run type-check   # Must be clean
npm run lint         # Must be clean
npm run build        # Must succeed
```

### Code conventions

1. **GPU math belongs in `aisimulators`** — never write sizing formulas inside React components.
2. **Pricing belongs in the `aicostings` service** — never add costing inside React components.
3. **PatternFly only** — do not add Tailwind, shadcn/ui, or any other component library.
4. **Sentence case everywhere** — no title case in headings or labels.
5. **Server components by default** — add `"use client"` only when needed.
6. **No `any` types** — TypeScript strict mode is enforced.
